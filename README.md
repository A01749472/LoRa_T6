# Cyber-physical-systems-team6
## Created by seventh semester students in the concentration of cyber-physical systems for Helgen Technologies.
The scope of this project includes the development of a communication system and a simple human-machine interface that will be used for the development of a full-stack automation platform for heavy machinery. It seeks to transmit telemetry data, which is generated by the stack itself. These data are generated by LoRa sensors that have different characteristics and their objective is to measure the movement of the vehicle and extract data from the environment. The sensors provide information at different rates and are all funneled into an autonomous stack across various nodes, including location, perception, and control.
